I had mentioned nosql in the system design, but today I felt like building more than learning, so I decided to go ahead with sqlite. Tomorrow will upgrade this to postgres.

Register, login, signup functionalities, plus CRUD functionalities for questions have been created.
Create for Answers is also finished. Will quickly finish the Read, update, delete tomorrow. 

I am feeling exhausted at the moment, and proper sleep should be prioritized over everything else, so I'm off.
